A sweet [youtube video downloader](https://tattered-lead-archaeopteryx.glitch.me) that is being maintained by someone who doesn't super know what he's doing, but he uses it a lot and fixes it when it causes him issues. Just download it, or go to https://tattered-lead-archaeopteryx.glitch.me. 

Run `node server.js` and it will run on port 3000, or whatever you change it to in the .env file. You can also use your own youtube api-key if you want. It's just to prevent 429 errors. Try to use node 18+ because node 16 doesn't work with proxies very well. If you get some errors saying it's missing packages, run `npm install`


## Your Project

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html` to change the content of the webpage
- `public/client.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `public/style.css` is the styles for `views/index.html`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
